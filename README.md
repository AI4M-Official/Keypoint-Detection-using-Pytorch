## Steps to Get Started

### Step 1: Data Preparation with Roboflow
1. **Create a New Project:** Start by creating a project in [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
2. **Upload Data:** Add your dataset to the platform.
3. **Annotate Images:** Use Roboflow's annotation tool to label keypoints in your images.
4. **Review Annotations:** Verify the annotations and make adjustments for accuracy.
5. **Generate Dataset:** Export your dataset in the desired format.
6. **Download Dataset:** Save the dataset locally for training and testing.

### Step 2: Clone This Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanushAI4M/Keypoint-Detection-using-Pytorch.git
```

---

### Step 3: Place Your Dataset
Organize your dataset in the following structure before placing it into the `Dataset` folder of the repository:

```
Dataset/
  train/
    annotations/
      img1.json
      img2.json
      ...
    images/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
      ...
  val/
    annotations/
      img1.json
      img2.json
      ...
    images/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
      ...
  test/
    annotations/
      img1.json
      img2.json
      ...
    images/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
      ...
```

---

### Step 4: Train the Model for Keypoint Detection
Run the following command to train the model:
```bash
python3 keypointrcnn.py
```

---

### Step 5: Test the Model
Use the `testing.ipynb` notebook for testing. Open the notebook and execute its cells to observe the output.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before starting training or testing. Refer to `requirements.txt` if available.
- Using a GPU is highly recommended for faster training and inference.
- Experiment with hyperparameters and dataset configurations to optimize performance for your specific use case.
